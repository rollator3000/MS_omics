this section uses the same scripts to generate the results as 5.3.1, therefore they are not included here

results_different_blocks_2020_05_06 contains the results for the priority-Lasso methods
results_different_blocks_ddsPLS_weight_2020_05_20 contains the results for the mdd-sPLS method

the scripts to calculate the AUC, generate the plots and
generate the tables are in the folder: generate_plots_tables

the table rows were manually pasted together in latex
