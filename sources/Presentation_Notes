PRESENTATION NOTES:

1. Slide -----
	- Welcome to the presentation of my master thesis. 
	  The title of my thesis is:
	  	'A comparison study of prediction approaches for multiple training data sets \& test data with block-wise missing values'

	 - The thesis was supervised by Dr. Roman Hornung

2. Slide -----
	- First of all lets have a look into the structure of the presentation

		[1] Firstly the term 'Multi-Omics' data needs to be defined, before 
		    the term 'Block-Wise missingness' is defined and explained then

		[2] Then the diverse approaches that are at the focus of my thesis are introduced:
		  	- Firstly the random forest model for classification is explained
		    - Following five differnt random forest based approaches that can deal with block-wise missingness are introduced

3. Slide -----
	- The 'Human Genome Project' was launched in 1990 and had the goal to sequence the first complete human genome ever 

	- After Investments of 2.7 Billion US-Dollar and 13 years of reserach it was offically finished. 
		--> On the one hand - It led to improved diagnosis and novel approaches in therapy!
		--> On the other hand - It led to a sharp drop of sequencing prices! 
			--> nowadays genome sequening is affordable for everyone ['Veritas Genomics' ~700$]

	- Besides the genome there are also multiple other types of '-omes'  [e.g. trancriptome, proteome, microbiomes, ...]
		--> for these other types of omes there was also a sharp drop of sequencing prices as with the genome
		--> The techologies that make data from molcular process available are generally called 'High Throughput Technologies'

	- Using the data of a single omics type in various statistical approaches was quite logical then. 
		--> In the clincical context it was additionally used to the regular clinical covariates  
		--> This has often been found to be useful for the predictions
			--> Hence the idea of incorperating more than just a single omics type was locial 
				--> coined the term 'Multi-Omics Data'

	- In such Multi-Omics Data the problem Block-Wise missing values is common.
		--> My thesis aims to compare diverse approaches that are able to deal with the block-wise missingness
